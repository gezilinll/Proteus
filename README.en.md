## What is this

Proteus is a **fully open editor development experiment** — from the first line of code, humans design the architecture while AI writes the code, together building an AI-native multimodal editor.

**Why Proteus?** The shape-shifting sea god from Greek mythology. Just like this editor, capable of handling any type of content.

## Core Philosophy

```
Humans: Architecture Design → Technical Decisions → Problem Diagnosis → Quality Control
    AI: Code Implementation → Pattern Reuse → Detail Handling → Test Writing
```

**This is not an AI-assisted project, but an AI-led implementation project.** We're exploring: How does software development change when AI becomes the primary code contributor?

## What You'll Learn

- 🏗️ **Building Complex Frontend Apps from Scratch**: Editor core principles without relying on existing frameworks
- 🤖 **AI-Native Architecture Design**: Making codebases AI-friendly for maximum human-AI collaboration
- 🎨 **Canvas Rendering Engine**: Complete implementation of scene graphs, coordinate transforms, and gesture interactions
- 🔧 **Engineering Practices**: Monorepo, framework-agnostic design, testable architecture
- 💡 **Lessons Learned**: Experience accumulated from multimedia development

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/gezilinll/Proteus.git
cd Proteus

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```
